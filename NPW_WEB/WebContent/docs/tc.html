            <!-- <p class="mb-4">This section will explain how to setup professional Front-End development environment for fast and smooth Unishop customization using these technologies.</p>
            <h3>Text Editor and Terminal (Command Line)</h3>
            <p>
               You can use any text editor at your disposal and available Command line tool (Command Prompt for Windows or Terminal on MacOS). My personal preference is <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code.</a> It is free, has great buil-in terminal (console), built-in git client, debugging, huge extensions library and available for MacOS, Windows, Linux.</p>
            <h3>Installing Node.ja and npm</h3>
            <p>In order to be able to setup Unishop development environment you will need to install Node.js and its Package Manager (npm).</p>
            <p>
               Node.js is absolutely free and available for download via its official website for MacOS, Windows, Linux systems. <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">Download Node.js and npm here.</a></p>
            <p>Learn more about Node Package Manager and available packages here: <a href="https://www.npmjs.com" target="_blank">https://www.npmjs.com</a></p>
            <h3>Installing packages necessary for Unishop development</h3>
            <p>When Node.js and npm is installed you are ready to install all dependencies necessary for Unishop development.</p>
            <u class="d-block mb-3">Inside your command line tool type:</u><kbd class="d-inline-block mb-3">npm install</kbd>
            <p>This will start the process of installing all dependencies which is listed inside <code>Unishop/package.json</code> file. Wait until installation is finished and jump to the next section <a href="working-with-grunt.html">Working with Grunt.</a></p>-->
